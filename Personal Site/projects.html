                <p class="shifted"> <em> Engineered and built a deep learning based detector using TF, Keras & Flask which predicts 
                    common diseases that display their symptoms externally like eye, skin, mouth & nail diseases by sending pictures 
                    from a mobile App to a Flask Web Server.</em></p>

                    <li> <p> <em>Built a smart traffic control system which detects ambulances in traffic signal junctions using YOLOv3 object detection algorithm and
                        makes way for the ambulance to move further without any hindrance. In addition to this med-cloud, a web app which uses fingerprint scanning 
                        was developed to retrieve patient medical history. </em> </p> </li>
